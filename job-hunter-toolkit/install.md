Because the applicaion is written using [Golang](https://golang.org/), it can be insalled like so:

### Run Command

`go get -u github.com/job-hunter-toolkit/job-hunter-toolkit`{{execute}}

> **Note:** In the future, pre-compiled binaries are planned to be released so that installation can be done without `go` needing to be installed.
